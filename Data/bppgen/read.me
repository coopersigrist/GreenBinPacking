=======================================================================

 Please use BPPGEN in the following form:
 
 BPPGEN <BSP.DAT
 
 with problem descriptors specified in file BSP.DAT (the example is 
 identical to that in the MLU working-paper).

 The problems generated by BPPGEN are summed up in the file SDAT.

 The main program as well as the output format reflect standards in 
 connection with our own research in the subject of one-dimensional 
 bin-packing and cutting stock and are only given to make an 
 executable version of the program available to you. Please use your 
 own standards, if you want...
